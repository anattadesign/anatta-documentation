# Prismic 2.0 

In prismic 2.0 we create a custom app from the partner account, which can later be installed into the store belonging to that partner account, which would act as our bridge for connecting with prismic repo and to do all of these fun stuffs, We dont need backend support. YAY!! Just kidding, backend devs are cool :P .
